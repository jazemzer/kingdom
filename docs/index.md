## Why is it important to study about the Kingdom of God

The simple answer is we are asked to do so - `But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you` [Mt 6: 33](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-33.htm).

But a nice side benefit is that we have all our needs covered. As 'all things' in the above verse refers to the `worries of life and body`[Mt 6: 25](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm). Specifically, `what to eat, what to drink, and what to wear` [Mt 6: 31](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-31.htm).
